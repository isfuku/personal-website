                        I am currently working at Blue Orange Digital as a Data Scientist, focusing on the development 
                        of data products. I have also acted as a consultant, delivering 
                        churn and customer behavior models based on time series data. I solved 
                        problems dealing with big data, developed pipelines for batch inference, 
                        machine learning model monitoring and automatic retraining, as well as 
                        implemented CI/CD pipelines.

                        During my time as a Data Scientist at Tabas, a Brazilian proptech, I developed a near 
                        real-time pipeline for estimating house prices for internal use, 
                        trained ML models to accurately predict property values, designed and implemented the company's 
                        data warehouse, and deployed web applications for realtors to facilitate in-depth 
                        analyses of apartments and their neighborhoods.
                        The approach to predicting house prices was based on an ensemble of a customized 
                        KNN model and a gradient boosting model, with apartment characteristics features and 
                        geolocation features created by a decision tree, which was equivalent to clustering the 
                        area of interest in house value zones.

                        As a Data Scientist consultant at Indicium, I worked with a variety of clients. 
                        I developed MLOps standards for easy training and deployment of ML models, provided 
                        solutions for real estate clients by predicting demand and estimating house prices, 
                        and built a fraud detection pipeline for an e-commerce that was able to detect over 
                        $100,000 in fraud annually with minimal cost.
                        The fraud detection algorithm was trained with Google Analytics and transaction data, which 
                        were feature engineered and stored in a feature store that fed tree-based classification 
                        models.
